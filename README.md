# UDPY (Urban Dictionary Python)

V 1.0.1
Exabyte

## Description

This is an Urban Dictionary search for Python. The reason why I made it, is because I noticed there are a lack of urban dictionary libraries in python so I made this library for everyone.

## Installation

1. Install BeautifulSoup using `pip install beautifulsoup4`
2. Download or clone this repo
3. Put UD.py in your project folder
4. Import it into your python file

## Commands

1. search(query)
2. version

## What you can do so far

1. You can get the title of the definition
2. You can get the meaning of the definition
3. You can get the example of the definition
4. You can find the person who made it, and the date it was created on

## How to use

Import the library using
`import UD`
Then use
`UD.search(query)`

**Example**

```
import UD

UD.search("cool")
```
